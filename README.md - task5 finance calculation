how to use this program:

this program is designed to calulate how much an individual will pay back on either an simple 
interest investment or a bond investment. 

step one, the user needs to choose which investment they wish to proceed with, 
this is completed by simply typing in the text box either "investment or bond" 

step two, the input for these equations are similar but use different language, 
you will first be prompted to input either investment or house price, second your 
will be prompted to input the interest rate you wish to pay in simple digits 
third you will be asked to input either the number of years or duration of the loan in which you would like to pay 
and finally for the investment string you will be asked to input if you require simple or compound interest, 
for the bond string the calculation will proceed after its asks the duration of the loan, 

step three, the program will work out the calculation for you and will output the answer at the 
bottom of the page.
