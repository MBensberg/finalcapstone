how to use the program 

introduction: 

for this program we were asked to create a program that uses defensive programming to help in debugging
within various types of software, this type of programming is used by sogtware developers, in this task
we were taught about the various types of errors we may incounter with in coding and how we could counter 
act these bugs. we were to use "if" statements as well as elif and else. we were to be mindful of how certain 
calculation would be processed throught the code and were reminded to be aware of the zerodivisionerror. 

installation instructions: 

if you want to view / contribute changes to work in this repository.
Go to this repository on github. (you’ll find it at https://github.com/MBensber/finalcapstone)
Click the “Fork” button at the top right.
You’ll now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.
Open a terminal/shell.
Type $ git clone git@github.com:username/the_repo
You’ll now have a local copy of your version of that repository.
once you have done this youll be able to view selected files as well as edit them. 
Change into that project directory (the_repo): $ cd the_repo
Add a connection to the original owner’s repository. $ git remote add myfriend git://github.com/myfriend/the_repo
To check this remote add set up: $ git remote -v

how to use this program:

this was a simple project that required the user to imput numbers and an operator to write and 
calculate a calculation, and then save it to a file, making that file accessable to the current or next 
user. 

step one, is to choose either, to proform a calculation, to proform a calculation from the saved files
or finally exit the program, (this is given as an option beecause the code is designed to loop)

step two, if you select the option 1 you will then be asked to enter you first number, choose which operator you 
would like for this calculation, then finally youll be asked to input your seond number. this will then 
proform the calculation and show you the full calculation at the bottom of the screen, giving you 
the same three option as before in step one, 
if you choose option two you will be given instruction to input a certain short line of code 
this will then open a file that contains all the previous calculation that have been entered. 
a list of the previously enter calculation will appear at teh bottom of the screen as well as the the 
same three options in step one. 
finally if you choose step three you will be presented with a short statment thanking you for 
using the program.
